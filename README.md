# CascadeMOO
A multi-objective optimization approach for the design of enzymatic cascade reactors. 
Simulation and optimization codes are provided.

## Setup
Install Anaconda on your PC
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
Open the Power shell prompt in anaconda navigator and run the following commands: 
`conda install -c conda-forge pyomo`
`conda install -c conda-forge glpk`
`conda install -c conda-forge ipopt 3.11.1 `

## Run the code
Save all files in the same directory. To run the simulation code, open it in spyder 
and run. You can simulate all results in the paper by selecting the optimal values
for the control variables from Tables 5-12. To run the optimization codes open both
files and run the xx file. You can recreate all optimization results by varying the 
values of the parameters: Φ^EC, Φ^EC and k_La.
